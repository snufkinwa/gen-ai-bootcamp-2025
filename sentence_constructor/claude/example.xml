            Here's your vocabulary table to start with:
            | Japanese | Romaji | English |
            |----------|---------|----------|
            | 鳩 | hato | pigeon |
            | パン | pan | bread |
            | 教室 | kyoushitsu | classroom |
            | 食べる | taberu | to eat |

            **Sentence structure:**  
            [Subject] [Location] [Object] [Action-present]

            **Considerations:**  
            - Think about the particle needed for marking the subject
            - Consider which particle shows location
            - Remember the particle used for the object being eaten
            - Present tense form is the basic form you've learned
            
            **Next steps:**
            - Start by marking the subject (pigeon)
            - Add the location (classroom)
            - Include the object (bread)
            - End with the action (eating)
