        - BAD: Vocabulary table is missing Japanese characters, making it incomplete.
        - BAD: Too much unnecessary introduction before showing vocabulary.
        - BAD: Clues should not provide polite verb forms, as students need to determine conjugations themselves.
        - BAD: Sentence structure should be more conceptual, such as: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Here’s your vocabulary table to start with:

        | English  | Japanese | Type |
        |----------|----------|------|
        | pigeon   | (はと) 鳩 | Noun |
        | café     | (カフェ) カフェ | Noun |
        | outside  | (そと) 外 | Noun |
        | birdseed | (えさ) 餌 | Noun |
        | to wait  | (まつ) 待つ | Verb |
        | to forget | (わすれる) 忘れる | Verb |
        | to bring | (もってくる) 持ってくる | Verb |

        **Sentence structure:**  
        [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        **Considerations:**  
        - This is a compound sentence with two connected ideas.  
        - The first part describes **a location where something is happening** (the pigeons waiting outside).  
        - The second part asks about **a past action** (forgetting the birdseed).  
        - Think about what **particle** is used for **location marking** and what **conjugation** is needed for past tense.  

        **Possible next steps:**  
        - Try forming a sentence using the vocabulary and structure provided.  
        - Ask for clues about **location marking**.  
        - Ask for clues about **connecting two sentences**.  
        - Ask for clues about **question formation**.  
        - Ask for clues about **verb conjugation**.
